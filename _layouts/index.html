		Hi,
		<br />
		<br />
		My name's Robbie. I live in Charlottesville, VA. This is my home on the open web. I'm currently in the midst of redesigning this site, so things might get shuffled around, 
		but I'll do my best to make it navigable.
		<br />
		<br />
		<b>My microblog</b>, where I post pictures, links, shortform thoughts, and miscellanea, can be found <a href="https://robertsapunarich.micro.blog/" target="blank">here</a>.
		It's hosted by <a href="https://micro.blog">Microblog</a>. You can subscribe to the RSS feed <a href="https://robertsapunarich.micro.blog/feed.xml" target="blank">here</a>.
		<br />
		<br />
		<b>My personal blog</b> contains longer-form writing. Whenever I publish something, I'll link to it via my microblog. You can view it <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/blog">here</a>
		and subscribe <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/feed.xml">here</a>.
		<br />
		<br />
		Links to <b>my writing published elsewhere</b> can be found <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/writing">here</a>.
		<br />
		<br />
		For work, I currently build software as a Senior Engineer on the Cloud Team at <a href="https://everactive.com" target="blank">Everactive</a>. For more details, you can view
		my resume by clicking <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/resume.pdf">here</a>.
		<br />
		<br />
		I don't maintain any social media (other than a rarely touched private Instagram). If you'd like to get in touch, I can be reached at robertsapunarich @ gmail dot com.
		<br />
		<br />
		As this is my personal space, any thoughts I publish here or elsewhere are solely mine, and do not express those of any employer or institution with which I am affiliated.
