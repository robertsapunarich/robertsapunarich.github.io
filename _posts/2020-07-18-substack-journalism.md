Yesterday [Alan Jacobs praised](https://blog.ayjay.org/return-of-the-dish/) the return of [Andrew Sullivan's The Dish](https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/coming-soon). He noted how it's part of an emerging trend among journalists to form their own, independent platforms where they're not beholden to the editorial demands of larger institutions. He also pointed out how directly paying writers for periodical writing quickly introduces a scaling problem for readers - paying five to ten dollars a month per writer quickly adds up. But, Jacobs suggests that putting writing behind paywalls rather than on the open might be "a feature rather than a bug! Fewer morons to insult you without reading what you write." I really like this line of thought, and have a few concerns about it, and some of Substack journalism's emerging patterns, as well.

First, I'm concerned that the actual content of Substack journalism is going to be increasingly self-congratulatory, self-referential, and montonous. More specifically, I'm concerned that good writers like [Matt Taibbi](https://taibbi.substack.com/) and [Jesse Singal](https://jessesingal.substack.com/) are going to devote most of their work to entries about "cancel culture", free speech, academic/journalistic freedom, etc. While discussing these issues is a worthy activity, it's not the _only_ thing worth writing. And I also think that left-leaning writers should be willing to criticize their own camp, if only for the sake of intellectual credibility. David French has been doing this on the right for years now, and it's long overdue for some progressive writers to do the same. But, between Taibbi and Singal's Substack home pages, all but headline seem devoted to criticizing sloppy thinking on the left. Again, I think these criticisms _should_ be made, but let's not stop writing about [actual systemic policy issues](https://taibbi.substack.com/p/where-did-policing-go-wrong) as well. If writers going independent are so tired of culture war-ing, then I hope that they'll eventually resume writing about something more interesting and original than culture wars.

Second, I'm concerned that this space of writers going independent is going to be primarily populated with those who already have existing platforms. Andrew Sullivan claims that going independent is necessary, ["especially for up-and-coming writers"](https://andrewsullivan.substack.com/p/coming-soon), but those who already have a following are going to have a much easier time finding financial backing than those who don't. Of course, part of Substack's appeal is that writers don't need to pay until they start generating revenue.
