I've recently had some thoughts swirling around in my head about "post-institutional futures". I'm unsure if that's the right phrase to describe these thoughts, but it's the best I've come up with thus far. Many other people have asserted that a number of our institutions — government, media, education, church, etc. — are undergoing various crises. I resonate with the observations that drive such assertions. 

More specifically, I think that many of these crises find their roots in a loss of purpose on the part of their respective institutions. Religious, journalistic, and educational institutions have lost the plot, forgetting why they exist in the first place, and in so doing undergo a sort of zombification, perpetuating their own existence and practicing a tenacious form of self-preservation, even (often especially) at the expense of their original missions.

Some examples:

- *Church*: The practice of reactionary, fear-based political engagement on the part of fundamentalists and evangelicals leading to an embrace of demagogic politicians, conspiracy theories, and a ruthless pragmatism that justifies the betrayal of Christian character. Similarly, in the more liberal protestant mainline, an uncritical embrace of contemporary cosmopolitan sensibilities, woke ideology, and a desupernaturalization of theology that strips Christianity of prophetic witness and transcendent hope. Both fundamentalist and liberal protestant insitutions have exchanged faithfulness for worldly success, and become inimical to the proclamation of the gospel.
