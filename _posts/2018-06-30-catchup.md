It's been a hectic couple of weeks, and I've done/experienced/read/thought about a few things that warrant their own posts, but I'll fill them in here.

  * My friend Bryant [started his own blog](https://sweetcassation.com/).
  * Additionally, my wife, [Jenoa, has been blogging with increased frequency and done an excellent job of chronicling both our life and her thoughts](http://www.jenoasaplin.com/).
  * I've been enjoying [Austin Kleon's blog](https://austinkleon.com/2018/06/27/knitting-at-the-end-of-the-world/).
  * [Virtue in the Wasteland's recent series on the Church and the desire for power](http://www.virtueinthewasteland.com/episodes/) have been especially thought-provoking.
  * In a similar vein, Fr. Stephen Freeman had [some good reflections on the meekness of God and the desire for power](https://blogs.ancientfaith.com/glory2godforallthings/2018/06/26/the-meekness-of-god/).
  * Jaron Lanier's [*Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now*](https://www.amazon.com/Arguments-Deleting-Social-Media-Accounts/dp/125019668X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1530377671&sr=1-1&keywords=jaron+lanier&dpID=41A5b9TMwwL&preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch) is a pretty damning and compelling read.
  * [*Nobody Move* by Denis Johnson](https://www.amazon.com/Nobody-Move-Novel-Denis-Johnson/dp/0312429614/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1530377758&sr=1-1&keywords=nobody+move+denis+johnson) is a fun, snappy piece of crime fiction to kick off summer reading.

That's about all I have for now. Enjoy your weekend.
