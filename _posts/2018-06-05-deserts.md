A piece my best friend wrote [was recently posted over at Mockingbird](http://www.mbird.com/2018/06/on-deserts-what-sexual-assault-star-wars-and-salvation-have-in-common/). (_Trigger warning: this story recounts sexual abuse_) No words of mine can do it justice. Here's a brief glimpse:

>Hope sought me out in that place. It clothed me and gave me water. It bade me to follow and find rest. Hope didn’t require me to be clean. It didn’t require me to be well-behaved. It wasn’t contingent on my political standing or sexual orientation. It was a rescue without requirements.

It's painful and moving, exploring trauma, storytelling, and grace. I can't recommend reading it enough. Proud of you, Collin.
