This is the first entry that’s testing the fortitude of my commitment to regularly publishing here. It’s been a hectic week — good, but hectic. Much to process, and much of it to be thankful for. Time spent with family. A caring church. New opportunities. Lots of food. These entries have so far leaned heavily on diary entries and synthesized them, but the demands on my time and will this past week have left me with 0 entries to glean from, so this’ll be a shorter one.

### Reading

I had the bright idea of starting Neal Stephenson’s [*Fall; or, Dodge in Hell*](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780062458711) and Fleming Rutledge’s [*Advent*](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9780802876195) in the same week. Both are fairly hefty. I also tore through [the third volume of Jeff Lemire’s *Black Hamer*](https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781506703893) today. I’ve been dipping into [*Faith Once Delivered*, a collection of sermons from our Rector, Paul N. Walker](https://store.mbird.com/shop/books/faith-once-delivered/). 

My reading habits are fairly erratic.

### Watching

Thankful for Disney+, as it allowed us to watch **Home Alone 2** this week.

### Listening

Gave [Common’s *Let Love*](https://open.spotify.com/album/6Rf7DjuM5vH2SzNJytE9h4?si=U0EcmKwgSsme5IybQzJ2Rg) another spin this week and it has yet to disappoint.

### Links

Not much internet reading this week.
