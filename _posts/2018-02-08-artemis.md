Andy Weir’s *Artemis* can best be described as an organized crime thriller on the moon. It’s quite a departure from his Mars-survival-blog, *The Martian*, but enjoyable nonetheless. Those who enjoyed his first book for its intricate technical aspects might find themselves wanting when reading *Artemis*. The details and descriptions are there, but the plot is what drives the narrative, not the engineering.

Nonetheless, I enjoyed living in the head of protagonist Jazz Bashara. She has all the wit, gumption, and intellect of Mark Watney, and is in some ways more developed as a character. I don’t think I enjoyed this novel more or less than *The Martian*, I just enjoyed it differently. I’m excited to see what story Andy Weir engineers next.
