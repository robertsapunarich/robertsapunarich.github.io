Four entries in and I broke the weekly rhythm, hence the title change to “update”. Oh well.

To be fair, last week was spent traveling to California for my W+R Studios’ year-end meetings/holiday party. I flew in on Tuesday the 10th. Meetings and work related events lasted until the morning of Friday the 13th. I got to spend the rest of Friday and all of Saturday seeing friends and catching up on **Watchmen**. I flew to DC on Sunday the 15th, where I met up with Jenoa. Spent much of Monday the 16th exploring DC, before taking the train back to Charlottesville that evening.

I think I’ve travelled more this year than any other. Let’s see if I can get a comprehensive list:

* January 3 — Fly back to CA after spending Christmas and New Year’s in Texas.
* February 20—23 — Four days in Pasadena for an event at Fuller Seminary.
* March 15-17 - Men’s retreat for church in Big Bear.
* April 4-7 - Fly to Texas for four days to attend the Mockingbird Tyler conference. While there, Jen has preliminary talks about the College Minister position.
* April 25-28 - Drive to and from Oakland for Jen’s friend’s wedding.
* April 29-May 2 - Fly to Boise for RESO Spring Technology Summit. During this time, Jen is in Palm Springs for an education conference.
* May 11-14 - Fly to Charlottesville for Jen’s interview at Christ Episcopal Church. She’s offered the position and accepts it on the last day of the trip.
* May 24-27 - Drive to Crestline (near Big Bear) to stay with friends at a cabin for Memorial Day weekend.
* June 17-19 - Much needed mini-vacation to Palm Springs. The first proper do-nothing vacation Jen and I had since our honeymoon.
* July 13 - [Day trip to Tijuana](http://www.jenoasaplin.com/2019/07/tijuana-day-trip.html). Neither of us had ever been.
* August 5-10 - Drive across the country from Rancho Santa Margarita, CA to Charlottesville, VA. Along the way we stay in Cloudcroft, NM; Glen Rose, TX; and Franklin, TN.
* August 12-15 - I fly right back to California for the Product Team summit at work. Two days after I moved across the country. I’M NOT TIRED YOU’RE TIRED.
* September 20-22 - Church retreat at Shrine Mont.
* October 1-8 - Fly to Texas unexpectedly for Jen’s grandmother’s funeral.
* October 15-21 - Fly to CA for [Here We Still Stand](https://www.herewestillstand.org/) and to see friends.
* November 17-20 - Fly to Nashville for RubyConf.
* December 10-15 - Fly to CA for W+R Studios year-end meetings.

So, for seven out of twelve months this year I got on a plane, for a total of nine trips by flight. It could have been ten; I originally planned to fly back to CA to be in a wedding the week after the product team summit, but Jen wisely convinced me that that was going to be way more than I could handle. In the midst of all the traveling, we also said goodbye to close friends, bought a house, dealt with loss, hosted family for Thanksgiving, and Jen started a new job (at which she has been doing fantastic). We’ve been given amazing new friends, and moved to a town that we love. It’s been a whirlwind year filled with a range of emotions.

That last trip will be the last one I take for some time. Much as I love seeing close friends, I’m also looking forward to not getting on a plane.

In an odd way, I felt a peace when I left California last week. I’m accepting having both feet firmly planted in Virginia. Of course there will be trips back west, and some of the friends I have there could never be replaced. But it’s not home anymore. I’m writing this from Charlottesville, VA — my new home.

### Reading

Still plodding through **Fall** and **Advent**. I also picked up [*Paul’s Apocalyptic Gospel by J. Christiaan Beker*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1479510.Paul_s_Apocalyptic_Gospel) from [The Center for Christian Study’s library](https://www.studycenter.net/) as a supplementary interlude to my reading of **Advent**. I’m also learning the Go programming language and making my way through [*The Little Go Book*](https://www.openmymind.net/assets/go/go.pdf).

### Watching

Thanks to Collin, I’m mostly caught up with **Watchmen**. Just need to watch that finale. Jen is also trying to get me hooked on **Mad Men** and it might be working.

### Listening

I told a friend of mine that I wanted to get into choral music. He recommended the Choir of King’s College, Cambridge. Their [*Best Loved Hymns*](https://open.spotify.com/album/4gOUkLyEUCTuv3KEv3WlHf?si=EVbJRhAKRb2xAe5Qcsp6OA) kept me company on the turbulent flight out to California. Also thankful for Penguin Cafe’s [*Handfuls of Night*](https://open.spotify.com/album/6YKbZ2ElHolhYuPeNaGN5x?si=735yq27nQZW3LuX_CDcEBw) and City and Colour’s [*A Pill for Loneliness*](https://open.spotify.com/album/1JaCRg0kiQCxm2jxIby648?si=LGYY2XkyQfay4KHbGVYxWg).
