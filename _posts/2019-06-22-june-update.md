It feels like periodically I write these “it’s been a while, but been really busy and all you know how it goes” posts. That said, I feel like there’s some justification for the silence over the last few months.

If you haven’t heard, Jen and I will be moving to Charlottesville, VA, where she’s accepted a role as College Grounds Minister at [Christ Episcopal Church](https://www.christchurchcville.org/). Excitement and anxiety and sadness and joy and wonder have ensued.

For the last 18 years, Orange County has been my home. My deepest friendships are here, and I intend for them to persist regardless of the distance. Despite my complaints about it, this place will always be part of me. I speculated about moving to Cville to attend UVA for grad school at one time, but that possibility was precluded when I decided to pursue programming instead of academia. Funny how things work out.

Ergo, this space has been quiet. I’ve had fits and starts of ideas, moments of “oh I should write that down”, but other matters take priority. For the next couple of months, my focus will be on enjoying valuable time with friends, packing, planning, and resting where I can. It’s a forced break from pseudo-profound thoughts, which I’m perfectly content with.

As to what will become of this blog, I’m not entirely sure. I intend to keep it around and will complete the redesign I last touched in early May according to `git log`. If I have to guess, the content will become more eclectic, focusing more on life updates than reflections on what’s going on “out there”. 

That said, life hasn’t completely stopped. [Jen recently shared some highlights](http://www.jenoasaplin.com/2019/06/weekly-bulletin.html), and here are a few of my own:

* Took a much needed vacation to Ace Hotel in Palm Springs. We’ve traveled quite a bit as a couple, but not since our honeymoon had we taken a true sit-by-a-pool-eat-drink-do-nothing vacation. This trip was a corrective to that.
* I’ve poked around with [this “course” from Gregory Brown’s *Practicing Ruby*](https://practicingruby.com/articles/study-guide-1) that I stumbled upon. It’s focused on using Ruby to implement low-level tools and Unix programs that are usually abstracted away for us in day-to-day development.
* I’m enjoying video games again. My brother in law introduced me to [Wargroove](https://wargroove.com/). Having never played a tactical RPG, it’s been a refreshing and fun experience. 
* After punting on it for years, I finally read Frank Herberts *Dune*. Worth every moment spent reading it. I’m still astounded by how Herbert balances page-turning action with philosophical/ecological/political/theological reflection. Other reading highlights include Diogenes Allen’s *Theology for a Troubled Believer* and Jenny Odell’s *How To Do Nothing*.
* I’ve fallen back in love with music. That feels strange to say, but I realized that I had been listening to a glut of podcasts and audiobooks, but was mostly unaware of what music had been released over the last year and half. Lately, I’ve been enjoying [Thrice’s *Palms - Deeper Wells*](https://open.spotify.com/album/0P40X7L9b9LpEkNYakq5KG?si=32QS4TQbRTSaElDUKVjUBA), [*Hundred Acres* from S. Carey](https://open.spotify.com/album/7J2oRTfH14BbakDbmqMgiM?si=1HqhpZN8TVOcVZ9qPpUzjQ), [Son of Cloud](https://open.spotify.com/album/7M6a595fM6YR1wokZOlIVN?si=xKUwr_RfScq9vN9e7rHrRg), and the new singles from [Alexisonfire](https://open.spotify.com/artist/53RsXctnNmj9oKXvcbvzI2?si=S6lYn1xATqCeCbZbpFwvAA) and [City and Colour](https://open.spotify.com/artist/74gcBzlQza1bSfob90yRhR?si=C0Wp23RrTNKhgOXv-kt1hw) (Dallas Green’s output is impressive to say the least).

That covers things for now. I'm sure there'll be more to share soon. Take care.
